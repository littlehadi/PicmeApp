This website uses [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) for post-processing automation. Below are instructions on how to set it up.

You must first install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) on your computer. Once that is done, open a command-prompt or
Terminal window in the root folder of this website, and paste the following command:

    npm install

**You only need to do this once**. This should install all the required packages. Once they are installed,
execute the following command to run Grunt to apply your changes to the CSS and/or JavaScript files:

    grunt
